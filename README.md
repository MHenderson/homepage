A process for creating new blog posts.

## Create a fresh repo

Generally speaking, if I'm going to write a new blog post then I think
I should be starting with a new repository. There are a couple of reasons
for this. One is that I don't know for certain that the work is going to
evolve into a blog post. Another is that I usually find it nicer working
with scripts than in an RMarkdown document. Another reason is that some
things I blog about are not going to be R based. For example, I might
write a post about the Java code I wrote to implement a hill-climbing
algorithm for constructing Room squares.

## Create a draft post

When the work is ready to be written about then create a draft post
in my personal blog. Update the version of my personal blog which is
hosted on my private website.
