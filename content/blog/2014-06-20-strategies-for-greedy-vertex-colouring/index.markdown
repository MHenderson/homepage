In the previous post we showed that a greedy vertex colouring of a graph `\(G\)`
uses at most `\(\Delta(G) + 1\)` colours. This sounds good until we realise that
graphs can have chromatic number much lower than the maximum degree.

The **crown graphs**, sometimes called Johnson graphs are complete bipartite
graph `\(K_{2n, 2n}\)` with a one-factor removed.

``` python
import networkx as nx

def one_factor(n):
    """The one-factor we remove from K_{2n,2n} to make a crown graph."""
    return zip(range(n),range(2*n - 1, n - 1, -1))

def crown_graph(n):
    """K_{n, n} minus one-factor."""
    G = nx.complete_bipartite_graph(n, n)
    G.remove_edges_from(one_factor(n))
    return G
```

``` python
G = crown_graph(6)

setfigsize(6,6)

options = {
  'with_labels': False,
  'node_size': 250,
  'width': 0.5,
}

nx.draw_circular(G, node_color = 'black', **options)
```

Crown graphs are bipartite and hence 2-colourable.

``` python
vcolour(G)
nx.draw_circular(G, node_color = colours(G), **options)
```

However, the maximum degree of a crown graph `\(G\)` of order `\(2n\)` is `\(n - 1\)` and,
with some vertex orderings, a greedy colouring of `\(G\)` uses `\(\Delta(G) + 1 = n\)`
colours.

``` python
import itertools

def bad_order(n):
    """Visit nodes in the order of the missing one-factor."""
    return itertools.chain.from_iterable(one_factor(n))

clear_colouring(G)
vcolour(G, nodes = bad_order(6))
nx.draw_circular(G, node_color = colours(G), **options)
```

We might ask, what vertex orderings lead to colourings with fewer colours? The
following theorem of Dominic A. Welsh and Martin B. Powell is pertinent.

**Theorem** (Welsh, Powell)

Let `\(G\)` be a graph of order `\(n\)` whose vertices are listed in the order
`\(v_{1}, v_{2}, ... v_{n}\)` so that
`\(\operatorname{deg} v_{1} \geq \operatorname{deg} v_{2}\geq \dots \geq\operatorname{deg} v_{n}\)`.
Then
`\(\chi(G) \leq 1 + \min_{1 \leq i \leq n}\{\max{\{i - 1, \operatorname{deg} v_{i}\}\}} = \min_{1\leq i\leq n}\{\max{\{i, 1 + \operatorname{deg} v_{i}}\}\}\)`

In the case of regular graphs, like the crown graphs, this theorem reduces to
the `\(\Delta(G) + 1\)` upper-bound on the chromatic number. For graphs that are not
regular this result suggests that we can get a tighter bound on the chromatic
number by considering orderings of vertices in non-increasing degree order.

The Grotzsch graph is an irregular graph that plays an important role in the
study of graph colouring. Unfortunately, it is not one of the named graphs in
NetworkX. We can, however,
[download](https://hog.grinvin.org/ViewGraphInfo.action?id=1132)
it from the
[House of Graphs](https://hog.grinvin.org)
as a file in *graph6* format. Then we can use the
`read_graph6` function to read it into a NetworkX graph.

``` python
G = nx.read_graph6('graph_1132.g6')

nx.draw_circular(G, node_color = 'black', **options)
```

![png](img/colouring-simulation-notebook_18_0.png)

We can compute the bound from the Welsh-Powell theorem.

``` python
def welsh_powell_number(G, nodes = None):
    """Calculate bound from Welsh-Powell theorem with nodes in given order."""
    if nodes == None: nodes = G.nodes()
    if len(nodes) == 0: return 0
    else:
        return 1 + min([max(i, G.degree(nodes[i])) for i in range(len(nodes))])

welsh_powell_number(G)
4
```

which is a significant improvement over the `\(\Delta(G) + 1 = 6\)` bound. In fact,
the chromatic number of the Grotzsch graph is 4 and a greedy colouring with 4
colours can be found.

``` python
vcolour(G)
nx.draw_circular(G, node_color = colours(G), **options)
```

We might suspect then that a good vertex colouring strategy is greedy colouring
with vertices in non-increasing degree order. In the next section we devise a
small test of this claim.

## Greedy Strategies for Colouring Small Graphs

NetworkX comes with a collection of all unlabelled,
[undirected graphs on seven or fewer vertices](http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/generated/networkx.generators.atlas.graph_atlas_g.html)
based on
Read and Wilson (2005)
.
The experiment below colours every graph in
this collection using four different vertex orderings: in order, random order,
decreasing degree order and increasing degree. In order is the order ordering
of vertices in the data representation of the graph. In the case of NetworkX
this just means that we colour vertices in the order they appear in
`G.nodes()`. Random order just means that we first shuffle this list using
`random.shuffle`. The other orderings are defined by the `degree_order`
function below.

``` python
def degree_order(G, reverse = False):
    """Vertices of G, ordered by degree."""
    return sorted(G.nodes(), key = G.degree, reverse = reverse)
```

In the following code extract we iterate over the graphs in `graphs_atlas_g()`
colouring each graph with each of the four above mentioned vertex ordering
strategies. We calculate the number of colours used by each colouring and, at
the end, we print out the totals of these numbers over all graphs.

``` python
import networkx as nx
import random

graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()

colours_used = {'inorder': 0, 'random': 0, 'decdeg': 0, 'incdeg': 0}

for G in graphs:

    nodes = G.nodes()
    inorder_nodes = nodes
    random_nodes = random.shuffle(nodes)
    
    orderings = {'inorder': nodes,
                 'random': random_nodes,
                 'decdeg': degree_order(G, reverse = True),
                 'incdeg': degree_order(G)}
    
    for ordering in orderings:
        vcolour(G, nodes = orderings[ordering])
        colours_used[ordering] += ncolours(G)
        clear_colouring(G)
```

| Ordering                | Colours used |
|:------------------------|:------------:|
| in order                |     4255     |
| random order            |     4252     |
| descending degree order |     4120     |
| ascending degree order  |     4468     |

We can see that the best ordering to use in this case is the ordering claimed in
Welsh and Powellâ€™s theorem. Ordering vertices by their degree from highest to
lowest. The worst case is the reverse ordering and randomised and natural
orderings lie somewhere in between.
