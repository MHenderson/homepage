the data this week was all about tornadoes.

remembering that i had been relatively close (10 miles) to the path of a particularly destructive tornado
([The 2009 U.S. event that prompted a new class of storm â€” super derecho](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/2009-u-event-prompted-class-085003480.html))
in 2009
at first i was just going to to plot all tornados paths in kentucky between sep 2007 and august 2010 when i was resident there.

i had something basically working that combined geom_sf for plotting the counties of kentucky and geom_segment for the tornado path.
that plot didn't work out so i started thinking about plotting all tornado paths in kentucky instead.
that map i created was too clutterred so i added a decade variable and plotted different decades on different maps using geom_facet
i also switched from using geom_segment to using geom_sf for the arrows.

![This image shows a grid of maps of the US state of Kentucky. Each map represents a different decade and is filled with coloured arrows showing the paths of tornadoes in that decade. The arrows are coloured according to the intensity of the tornado. The plot shows that during the 1980s there were relatively few tornadoes in Kentucky while in the 1970s there were a large number of very intense torndoes. In recent decades the number of tornadoes appears to have increased but there are fewer of high intensity.](ky-tornadoes-plot.png)

originally the plot also had superimposed county boundaries.
but i had to leave out the county boundaries for a couple of reasons.
they interfered with the state outline lines.
and they also made the plot too messy when combined with the arrows.
i wish i could have found a way to add them subtly so they could be seen but without affecting the overall simplicity of the final plot.

although the final plot lacks a compelling story i think it does have some of the property of allowing the viewer to find something interesting by exploring the plot.
for example, it seems clear that in 1970s there were a large number of powerful tornadoes, especially compared to the 1980s.

spending time on titles, lables and headings improved the plot quite a bit.
and i used my favourite theme from hrbrthemes for the first time in a while.
i was quite concerned about publishing something misleading.
hopefully i have done a decent job by taking the extra care to label the 1950s and 2020s facets properly as well as finding space to describe the change of scale in 2007 from F to EF.

This was the first time I used Github Codespaces for an entire project.
All of the work was done on Codespaces inside a rocker/geospatial devcontainer container.
At first I worked in RStudio but once I had established a targets pipeline I was happier working in VSCode.
Resuming work inside a fresh codespace is just a matter of calling renv::restore() followed by targets::tar_make().
Of course this is only really useful because of RStudio Package Manager.
Installing everything from source could be frustratingly slow.
