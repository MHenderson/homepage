{keedwell} includes functions for extending latin squares based on the
following theorem of Marshall Hall Jr:

### Theorem 1 (Hall, 1945)

> Given a rectangle of n - r rows and n columns such that each of the
> numbers 1, 2, â€¦, n occurs in every row and no number occurs twice in
> any column, then there exist r rows which may be added to the given
> rectangle to form a latin square.

The function `add_rows` takes as input a latin
rectangle (represented by a data frame) and outputs a new data frame
representing a latin rectangle with additional rows.
