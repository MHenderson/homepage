<p>This is the first post in a series about
<a href="http://visjs.org/">vis.js</a>,
a Javascript
library for dynamic browser-based visualisations of graphs and timelines.</p>
<p>vis.js has four main components <code>DataSet</code>, <code>DataView</code>, <code>Timeline</code> and
<code>Graph</code>. In this post and subsequent posts about vis.js we will only
consider the <code>Graph</code> component, used for creating and displaying graphs.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to reproduce a very simple example of a webpage with
embedded graph visualisation. So that the code will be as simple as possible
we will create and draw a very simple graph, the complete graph on three
vertices \(K_{3}\).</p>
<p>To see a live demonstration of the example we are going to recreate you
can look
<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mhenderson/9767470">here</a>
The complete source code of the example can be
found in this
<a href="http://gist.github.com/9767470">gist</a>
on
<a href="http://github.com">Github</a>
or at the end of this post.</p>

<h2>Installing vis.js</h2>
<p>As vis.js is a Javascript library the easiest way to use it is by creating
a simple webpage.</p>
<pre class="html"><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;vis.js Graph demo&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;http://visjs.org/dist/vis.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;link href=&quot;http://visjs.org/dist/vis.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The important things to notice here are the <code>script</code> and <code>link</code> elements in
the header and the empty <code>div</code> element in the body.</p>
<p>The <code>script</code> element links to the vis.js source at the visjs.org website and
<code>link</code> element links to the vis.js css file.</p>
<p>The empty <code>div</code> serves as a container for the drawing of the <code>Graph</code> object
we will create with vis.js.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating a graph</h2>
<p>Creating a <code>Graph</code> object in vis.js is done by calling the <code>Graph</code> function
with arguments for the container and graph data. A third argument allows us
to pass in options about how to render the graph.</p>
<p>The nodes of our graph are an array of objects. Each object must have an
<code>id</code>. A <code>label</code> property can also be given and its value will be used as a
label when the graph is rendered. If no labels are given then vis.js uses ids
as labels.</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var nodes = [
  {id: 1, label: &#39;a&#39;},
  {id: 2, label: &#39;b&#39;},
  {id: 3, label: &#39;c&#39;}
];</code></pre>
<p>The edges are similarly an array of objects. Each object defines a <code>from</code> and
<code>to</code> property and represents an edge in the graph with end nodes given by the
id values of these two properties.</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var edges = [
  {from: 1, to: 2},
  {from: 1, to: 3},
  {from: 2, to: 3}
];</code></pre>
<p>Now to create a graph in vis.js, first pack the nodes and edges into a data
object</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var data = { nodes: nodes, edges: edges };</code></pre>
<p>and then grab the container from the document object</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var container = document.getElementById(&#39;graph&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>Finally, call the <code>Graph</code> function with <code>container</code> and <code>data</code> as the
first two parameters.</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var graph = new vis.Graph(container, data, {});</code></pre>
<p>The third argument is for an options object. This will be introduced in a
subsequent post. For now, we choose default options by passing an empty object.</p>
</div>
<div id="displaying-a-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Displaying a graph</h2>
<p>Opening the finished
<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mhenderson/9767470">webpage</a>
in a browser should display a dynamic,
interactive image that looks something like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/triangle.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Screenshot of triangle graph with vis.js</p>
</div>
<p>Unlike this static image, the drawing of \(K_{3}\) rendered by the browser
when opening the finished
<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mhenderson/9767470">webpage</a>
should respond to a variety of
manipulations. You should be able to zoom and drag the graph around as well
as independently manipulate node and edge components.</p>
<p>In upcoming posts we will discuss how to set options to create different
drawings and how to import graphs from other software packages. We will also
explain some of theory behind the algorithms used for drawing the graph and
the physics of modelling the motion of the graph in response to user input.</p>
