<p>Continuing on from
<a href="/post/2014/03/28/visjs-01">an earlier post</a>,
in
this post we are going to look at some customisation options for
<a href="http://visjs.org/">vis.js</a>.</p>
<p>A lot can be customised in vis.js. Some options, like those
for layout, affect the entire graph. Other options, like node colours and
shapes, affect nodes or groups of nodes. Yet other options, like width and
style, affect edges.</p>
<p>As this blog is focused on graphs that arise in graph theory (as opposed to
Network Analysis or other data-based disciplines) we will aim to reproduce a
traditional style of graph drawing reminiscent of the simple black and white
line drawings found in books and papers on graph theory. In future posts we
will investigate visualisation of colouring algorithms and it will be useful
to have such a default un-coloured style.</p>
<p>We are going to aim for the style of graph shown in this
<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mhenderson/10667009">example</a>.
Black vertices, no labels, straight edges and a layout that tries to minimise
edge-crossings as far as possible.</p>
<p>There are three steps. First we configure options related to the graph layout,
then we style nodes and finally we style edges.</p>
<div id="graph-options" class="section level2">
<h2>Graph Options</h2>
<p>In an upcoming post we will look more closely at the different layout
algorithms in vis.js and options for configuration of physics modelling that
allows for dynamic interaction with the rendered graph. In this post we will
settle for a layout with straight edges where nodes are placed by a repulsion
algorithm.</p>
<p>To configure vis.js to produce such a layout involves nothing more than setting
the value of two properties of the options object. This options object is then
passed as a parameter to the <code>Graph</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>smoothCurves</code> property has the default value of <code>true</code> and by changing
this to false we require vis.js to use straight edges to join nodes.</p>
<p>The <code>physics</code> property supports a wide range of options but here all we want
is to disable the Barnes-Hut layout algorithm and revert to a simpler
repulsion layout. This is done by setting to <code>false</code> the value of the
<code>enabled</code> property of the <code>barnesHut</code> property object.</p>
<p>The code below is written in
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>
and we use the
<code>coffee</code> compiler to translate it into Javascript.</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>options =
  smoothCurves: false
  physics:
    barnesHut:
      enabled: false</code></pre>
<p>With the CoffeeScript compiler installed and the above code contained in a file
called <code>options.coffee</code> we can produce Javascript output with:</p>
<pre><code>$ coffee --compile --bare options.coffee</code></pre>
<p>Then to configure all graphs in a HTML document we simply have to link to the
resulting Javascript source.</p>
<p>For more information about graph options in vis.js see the
<a href="http://visjs.org/docs/graph.html#Configuration_options">graph options</a>
pages of the vis.js
<a href="http://visjs.org/docs/index.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<div id="node-styling-options" class="section level2">
<h2>Node Styling Options</h2>
<p>Our goal is to have nodes rendered as black filled circles. The shape of a
node is configured by setting the value of the <code>shape</code> property of the
<code>nodes</code> object. The <code>color</code> property is a little more complicated. It
allows us to specify separately the colour of the border and background of a
node. We can also set different values for the border and background when the
node is highlighted.</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>nodes:
  shape: &#39;circle&#39;
  fontColor: &#39;black&#39;
  color:
    border: &#39;black&#39;
    background: &#39;black&#39;
    highlight:
      border: &#39;grey&#39;
      background: &#39;grey&#39;</code></pre>
<p>By choosing to have a black font colour gives a nice side-effect; labels are
not visible on unhighlighted nodes. This is consistent with the graph theory
setting where unlabelled graphs are prevalent.</p>
<p>We have opted for a subtle highlight effect by setting both border and
background to grey. This colour scheme makes node labels visible when selected.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive list of node options see
<a href="http://visjs.org/docs/graph.html#Nodes_configuration">this page</a>
vis.js documentation.</p>
</div>
<div id="edge-styling-options" class="section level2">
<h2>Edge Styling Options</h2>
<p>The main difference between the default styling of vis.js edges and the
textbook style we are aiming to reproduce is that edges are curves instead of
straight lines. To remedy this requires only that we choose the <code>'line'</code>
option for the <code>style</code> property in the <code>edges</code> object.</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>edges:
  width: 3
  style: &#39;line&#39;
  color:
    color: &#39;black&#39;
    highlight: &#39;grey&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The only other changes we have made are to increase the thickness of the edges
by setting the value of the <code>width</code> property and choosing grey as the
highlighting color of edges to match the highlighting of selected nodes.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive list of edge options see
<a href="http://visjs.org/docs/graph.html#Edges_configuration">this page</a>
vis.js documentation.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above configuration gives graph visualisations that looks something like
the traditional line drawings found in graph theory literature.</p>

<p class="caption">Screenshot of bull graph with vis.js</p>
</div>
<p>For now we do not have complete control over the layout. It is generated by
the repulsion algorithm and our interactions after loading the page. In future
posts we will discuss how to configure both the layout algorithms and the
dynamic interactions.</p>
