<p>In this post we show how to use
<a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>
to find a nice drawing of a
graph with hundreds of vertices. A nice drawing in this context is one that
has few edge crossings and whose nodes are regularly distributed over a fixed
area with a small number of different edge lengths.</p>
<p>Ideally we would like to find a <em>reproducible</em> method for drawing graphs
that is guaranteed to always produce a nice drawing in the above sense. The
method demonstrated below does not entirely achieve this but is a useful first
step in the right direction.</p>
<p>In future posts we hope to develop these methods by using scriptable tools and
improved techniques to enhance the reproducibility of this method.</p>

<h2>Lobster graphs</h2>
<p>For simplicity here we consider only lobster graphs. From
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com">MathWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lobster.html">lobster</a> is a
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tree.html">tree</a> having the property
that the removal of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TreeLeaf.html">leaves</a> leaves
a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Caterpillar.html">caterpillar</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a caterpillar is a tree such that removal of its <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Endpoint.html">endpoints</a>
leaves a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PathGraph.html">path graph</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Lobsters, being trees, are planar graphs and with small lobsters plane drawings
like the one above can be achieved easily. Notice that although this drawing is
not an especially elegant one it does have the benefits of making both the
planarity and the lobsterity of the graph clear.</p>
<p>For comparison, consider the following drawing of a large lobster graph.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/lobster.svg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Image of lobster graph.</p>
</div>
<p>This drawing (the random node placement layout Gephi defaults to on
loading a new graph) reveals neither the planarity nor the lobsterity of the
graph.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the above lobster graph has 287 vertices and, being a tree,
286 edges. It was generated in Python using NetworkX. The following command
creates a
<a href="lobster.gexf">file</a>
in Graph Exchange Format (GEXF).</p>
<pre><code>$ python -c &quot;import networkx as nx;nx.write_gexf(nx.random_lobster(100, 0.5, 0.5, seed=0), &#39;lobster.gexf&#39;)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>random_lobster(n, p, q, seed=None)</code> function returns a lobster with
approximately <code>n</code> vertices in the backbone, backbone edges with probability <code>p</code>
and leaves with probability <code>q</code>. The <code>seed</code> is set to zero for the sake of
reproducibility.</p>

<div id="force-directed-drawing-algorithms" class="section level2">
<h2>Force-directed drawing algorithms</h2>
<p>The type of drawing we are looking for, one with as few edge crossings and
different edge lengths as possible is the kind of drawing aimed for by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing">force-directed</a>
algorithms. Such methods use simulations of
forces between nodes to decide node placements. Electrical forces have the
effect of making non-adjacent nodes move further apart and spring
forces between adjacent nodes have the effect of reducing the variety of
edge lengths.</p>
<p>Gephi makes the standard
<a href="https://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Fruchterman-Reingold">Fruchterman-Reingold</a>
force-directed
algorithm available alongside a layout method unique to Gephi called
<a href="https://gephi.org/2011/forceatlas2-the-new-version-of-our-home-brew-layout/">Force-Atlas</a>.</p>
<p>These two layout methods, although both built on force-directed foundations,
produce wildly different layouts with the same lobster graph input.</p>
<p>Beginning with random placement of nodes, the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm
implementation in Gephi produces a layout having uniform distribution of
nodes across a disk; albeit one with very many edge-crossings.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/lobster2.svg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Image of lobster graph.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a well-known problem with force-directed methods. The algorithm has
probably discovered a local minimum. Unfortunately this local minimum is poor
in comparison with the global minimum.</p>
<p>The Force-Atlas algorithm, on the other hand, creates a layout which has few
crossings but without the nice node distribution of the Fruchterman-Reingold
layout.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/lobster3.svg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Image of lobster graph.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the great benefits of Gephi is that is easy to experiment with combining
these methods to produce a layout which has the benefits of both.</p>
</div>
<div id="combining-force-atlas-with-fruchterman-reingold" class="section level2">
<h2>Combining Force-Atlas with Fruchterman-Reingold</h2>
<p>First using the Force-Atlas method to find a nearly plane drawing and then
using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm on the resulting drawing produces a
new drawing that is both nearly planar and has evenly distributed nodes with
relatively few different edge lengths.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/lobster4.svg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Image of lobster graph.</p>
</div>
<p>Another benefit of Gephi, not illustrated here, is that some of the layout
methods allow for interaction during execution. This means that, where there
are edge-crossings we can manually move vertices around a little bit to help
eliminate them. So a layout like the one shown, which has few edge crossings
can probably be improved to a plane drawing with a little manual interaction.</p>
