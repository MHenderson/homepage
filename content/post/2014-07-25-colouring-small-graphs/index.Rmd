    The Tutte polynomial of a graph, also known as the partition function of the
    q-state Potts model is a 2-variable polynomial graph invariant of
    considerable importance in both combinatorics and statistical physics. It
    contains several other polynomial invariants, such as the chromatic
    polynomial and flow polynomial as partial evaluations, and various numerical
    invariants such as the number of spanning trees as complete evaluations.
    However despite its ubiquity, there are no widely available effective
    computational tools able to compute the Tutte polynomial of a general graph
    of reasonable size. In this article we describe the implementation of a
    program that exploits isomorphisms in the computation tree to extend the
    range of graphs for which it is feasible to compute their Tutte polynomials,
    and we demonstrate the utility of the program by finding counterexamples to
    a conjecture of Welsh on the location of the real flow roots of a graph.

In
[Chromatic Polynomials](/posts/2014-07-11-chromatic-polynomials)
we showed how to partially reproduce the data on
[small graph colourings][roylecolourings]
made available by Gordon
Royle. In that post we used NetworkX, sympy and the
[*tutte_bhkk*][tuttebhkk]
module of
XXX
to reproduce Royle's
results up to order $n = 7$.

In
[A Chromatic Number Program](post/2014-07-18-a-chromatic-program)
we developed a tool, `chromatic`, for computing chromatic numbers based
on
[*tutte*](),
an implementation of the Tutte polynomial by
@haggardComputingTuttePolynomials2010
.

In this post we attempt to reproduce Royle's chromatic number distribution data
with `chromatic`.

A Small Chromatic Hack
----------------------

The `chromatic` script that we introduced last week had at least one flaw. It
was not able to correctly calculate the chromatic number of a graph with no
edges. This seems to be due to the fact that the input format for the `tutte`
program used to calculate the chromatic polynomial does not support empty
(i.e. edge-less) graphs.

One solution, shown below, is to calculate, using the Graphviz program `gc` the
number of edges in the input graph. If this number is zero then we return 1
and exit the script.

    n_edges=`gc -e $file_gv\
             | sed -n 's/\([0-9]*\) %.*/\1/p'\
             | tr -d ' '`

    if [[ ${n_edges} -eq 0 ]] ; then
        echo 1
        exit 1
    fi

Simulation Overview
-------------------

Most of the work in this simulation is done by a single Bash script. In addition
to looping through the graph data computing chromatic numbers we also have to
first convert data into the right format and, afterwards, analyse the results.

More specifically, we have to do the following things:

1. Convert *graph6* graph data from Brendan McKay's homepage into Graphviz
   DOT format.
2. Iterate through all connected graphs of order at most 7 and for each graph
   compute the chromatic number and append it to a file of chromatic numbers
   of all connected graphs of the same order.
3. Analyse the distribution of chromatic numbers in the resulting results files.

In the rest of this post we describe each of these steps in more detail.

Data Conversion
---------------

We begin with the
[small graph data](http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html)
from Brendan McKay's
homepage. Among the various files he has made available are a collection which
contain all graphs of order 10 or less. These are made available in *graph6*
format with one graph per line in files that contain all graphs of a specific
order. A separate collection gives all of the connected graphs of order at most
10. The latter is the collection we are going to be using.

As things stand, *chromatic*, reads one graph at a time from an input file and
that graph is expected to be in Graphviz DOT format. In the future it will be
possible to run *chromatic* directly on *graph6* data but for now we just do
the conversion to DOT format before running the simulation.

A
[Makefile](https://github.com/MHenderson/graphs-collection/blob/master/src/Small/Makefile)
that converts the *graph6* data into folders of files
in DOT format, with one file per graph, has been added to the graphs-collection
project. So to build this data we now merely clone the *graphs-collection*
repository and call `make` from the `src/Small` folder.

Doing this creates a new folder `src/Small/output` which contains subfolders
`n_gv` and `nc_gv` for all $2 \leq n \leq 8$. The folder `n_gv` contains all
graphs of order $n$ in DOT format and the folder `nc_gv` contains all
connected graphs of order $n$ in DOT format.

The Main Loop
-------------

Once we have the data in DOT format our simulation is a very simple Bash script
that takes two arguments, a lower and upper bound. The chromatic numbers of
all (connected) graphs of orders between the lower and upper bounds are computed
and stored in results files, one chromatic number per line, for subsequent
analysis.

    #!/bin/bash

    BASEDIR=~/workspace/graphs-collection/src/Small/output

    for order in `seq $1 $2`;
    do
     echo ${order}
     graphs=`ls ${BASEDIR}/${order}c_gv/*`
     for graph in ${graphs};
     do
      chromatic ${graph} >> ${order}c_result.txt;
     done
    done

The `BASEDIR` variable in this script points to the output folder generated in
the previous step.

Analysis
--------

A second small Bash script now is used to process the output from the previous
step and collate the chromatic numbers for each order. This script also takes
two parameters as input, the upper and lower bounds on order.

    #!/bin/bash

    RESULTS_DIR=results/14_07_31_results

    for i in `seq $1 $2`
    do
     echo order: $i
     for j in `seq 1 8`
     do
     echo $j: `grep -c $j ${RESULTS_DIR}/${i}c_result.txt`
     done
    done

Here `RESULT_DIR` points to the location of the folder containing the output
from the previous step

Results
-------

The data collected by the simulation described above agrees with Royle's
table for all $n \leq 6$. For $n = 7$ we get the following numbers, which
are obviously wrong.

|  2 |   3 |   4 |  5 | 6 | 7 |
|----|-----|-----|----|---|---|
| 44 | 486 | 294 | 29 | 0 | 0 |

We would expect that the number of connected graphs of order 7 having chromatic
number 7 is (at least) 1. We also expect that there are connected graphs of
order 7 having chromatic number 6. Those last two zeros, therefore, point to
a flaw in our simulation.

It seems most likely that the error was introduced in converting the data from
*graph6* to DOT format. Our methods for converting are not designed with much
rigour and it seems plausible that they aren't reliable for larger graphs. There
are at least a couple of things we can do to progress and hopefully fix this
problem.

One method is to improve the reliability of our conversion tools. To do this we
should match the conversions described in the Makefile in
`graphs-collection` with some testing of basic parameters in the resulting
data.

Another approach is to modify `chromatic` to work with files in *graph6* one
graph per line format.

In upcoming posts we will look at both of these approaches and return to
Royle's data with a view to reproducing his results as far as possible.
