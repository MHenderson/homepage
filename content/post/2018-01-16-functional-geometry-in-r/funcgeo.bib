abstract="An algebra of pictures is described that is sufficiently powerful to denote the structure of a well-known Escher woodcut, Square Limit. A decomposition of the picture that is reasonably faithful to Escher's original design is given. This illustrates how a suitably chosen algebraic specification can be both a clear description and a practical implementation method. It also allows us to address some of the criteria that make a good algebraic description.",
