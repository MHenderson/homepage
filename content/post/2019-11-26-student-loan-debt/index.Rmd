```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,

```

This week's data is from the Department of Education courtesy of Alex Albright.

Data idea comes from Dignity and Debt who is running a contest around data viz for understanding and spreading awareness around Student Loan debt.

There are already some gorgeous plots in the style of DuBois.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(tidytuesdayR)

tuesdata <- tt_load(2019, week = 48)
```


```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)

tuesdata$loans %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = quarter, y = total)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~year)
```
