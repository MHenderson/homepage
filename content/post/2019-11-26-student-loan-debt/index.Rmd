This week's data is from the Department of Education courtesy of Alex Albright.

Data idea comes from Dignity and Debt who is running a contest around data viz for understanding and spreading awareness around Student Loan debt.

There are already some gorgeous plots in the style of DuBois.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)

loans <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-11-26/loans.csv")

loans %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = quarter, y = total)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~year)
```
