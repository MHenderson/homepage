For week fifty-one of 2019
the data came from
Amber Thomas
and was all about
dogs available for adoption
in September 2019
in the United States
via PetFinder.

I ended up with three plots.
The third of which was a total failure
so only two are presented here.

The first shows how the number of
imports and exports varies by state.

I am relatively happy with this plot
which uses Bob Rudis's
statebins
package.
I think it makes it clear
that a lot of dogs are exported
from southern states,
particularly Texas
and a lot of dogs are imported
to northern states
like Washington
and New York.
I also think it does
quite well at leaving some
of the work to the viewer
and not just trying to
sell a particular story.

The second plot shows the most
popular dog names.

I'm not particularly happy
with this one.
I don't think you can learn
much from looking at this plot.
I coloured the names
with the number of syllables
of every name
using the
syllable
package by Tyler Rinker.
