edge-, list- and total-colouring. It wraps the python-constraint
package and provides conversions between graph-colouring and
constraint satisfaction problems.

## minion-r

The goal of the minion-r project is to allow R users to exploit
the Minion constraint solver. The project consists of three
R packages: rminion, minionator and mopr.

* https://github.com/minion-r

### rminion

If you have a CSP in Minion format and only need to call Minion
from R and get the result as text then you only need rminion.

* https://minion-r.github.io/rminion/
* https://github.com/minion-r/rminion

### minionator

If, in addition, you also want to generate CSPs using the R
programming language then you also need minionator.

* https://minion-r.github.io/minionator/
* https://github.com/minion-r/minionator

### mopr

Finally, if
you want to automatically parse the results of calling Minion
into an R data frame then you also need mopr.

* https://minion-r.github.io/mopr/
* https://github.com/minion-r/mopr
