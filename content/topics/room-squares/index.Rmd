    In this paper we describe and discuss hill-climbing algorithms for the
    construction of one- factorizations of complete graphs, and orthogonal
    one-factorizations of complete graphs (i.e., Room squares).

A **Room square**
is an $n Ã— n$ array filled with $n + 1$
different symbols in such a way that:

  1. Each cell of the array is either empty or contains an unordered pair
     from the set of symbols
  2. Each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and column of the array
  3. Every unordered pair of symbols occurs in exactly one cell of the array.

![seven by seven room square coloured by min value](figure/room.png)

In the above image colours are used instead of symbols.
This is a $7 \times 7$ Room square because every colour appears
once in every row and every column (either as the
inner coloured square or as the coloured border around
the inner coloured square)
and because every colour appears
once with every other colour.

For example, red appears with pink in the first
row, yellow in the second, purple in the third, green
in the forth, brown in the fifth, blue in the sixth
and orange in the seventh.
